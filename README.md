# Turbo Commit CLI (deprecated)

# This project was refactored and renamed it.. So you should take a look to [Turbo Git](https://github.com/labs-js/turbo-git) from now on.

This CLI tool was originally thought for implementing the [turbo-commit](/CONVENTION.md) convention easily. Now It's more than that.. You can use it with any other commit convention (aviable soon). And it's also good for tuning out of the box git commands.

If you enjoy the good quality software and you work for have it, You'll enjoy using a commit convention on your projects that ensures readability and understanding. For sure you can also make some great improvements on how you use git in the command line everyday.
Wouldn't it be great to have a tool that ensure all of this for you and for your team?

## Install

    npm install -g turbo-commit

Then you're able to use the `turbo` command. From git: `git turbo <command>` or with the git alias: `git tc`,`git tl` and `git ta`


## Demo (outdate, now this is even better)

Select what you want to add by moving with the arrow key and pressing space.. then enter. (This will be improve it soon, with a better UX)

> Now you are able to commit using `turbo commit` or `git tc` command as follows:

    turbo commit

After that, you'll see the possible tags for your turbo-commits:

>Choose your tag to wrap your commit message, press enter.
>Now insert your commit title and the description, if you want, and you're done.
